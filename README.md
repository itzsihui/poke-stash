Project Description: 
Telegram-based gachapon mini-app that lets users draw graded Pokémon cards instantly using Toncoin (TON). Inspired by the thrill of capsule toy machines and booster pack openings, Pullemon delivers both digital excitement and real-world value in one seamless experience.

How it works: 
Users tap a button to “pull” a card. Each pull reveals a random graded Pokémon card with assigned rarity tiers (Common, Rare, Epic, Legendary - based on value) that is represented by an NFT. Cards are displayed digitally in the user’s inventory/wallet, complete with images and grading details.

Trust & authenticity: 
Every prize comes from a pool of professionally graded slabs (PSA, BGS, CGC), ensuring authenticity and condition. Odds are transparent, verifiable, and powered by TON blockchain logic.

Hybrid reward system: 
Players can keep their cards digitally for bragging rights, trade them (future feature), or request physical delivery straight to their doorstep.

Accessible and viral: 
Built inside Telegram, Pullemon is frictionless — no new app or complex crypto setup required. Users can share their pulls directly in chats, fueling community excitement and organic growth.
